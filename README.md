# Glaucoma_FundusDetection

**_Completed in fullfillment of the Study Oriented Project Course at BITS Pilani; Advisor: Dr. K K Gupta_**

We aim to automate glaucoma identification, particularly for resource-constrained settings. Glaucoma is prevalent globally, and is a leading cause of vision loss and blindness. Automating the identification process will aid timely diagnosis and save many people's vision.

1. "AugmentationOfImages.py" - Reads layered raw fundus image, applied affine transformations, translates it and does gamma correction (pre-processing steps implemented).
2. "MovingImagesRandomly.py" - Random resorting to check efficacy of implementation with varied training data (pre-processing step).
3. "GreenChannel.py" - Single channel extraction code for the Fundus images.
4. "CodeAugGlaucoma" - Files beggining with this are various version of the model and the full pipeline implementation.

Feel free to use any off the shelf retinal fundus images for your testing.
